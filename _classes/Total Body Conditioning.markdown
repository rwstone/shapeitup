Body conditioning classes are designed to provide total fitness and overall toning through working every major muscle group in a conditioning-style workout. You use your own body weight as resistance to achieve muscle definition. Exercisers wanting to attend a body conditioning class should wear comfortable workout gear and footwear, we recommend You bring your own mat, and towel.
