Barre Fusion is a signature full-body workout designed to give you chiseled abs, toned legs, cut arms and a high, lifted butt. This ballet-inspired, core-centric class focuses on isolated excercises, alignment, flexibility and posture as you work through targeted mindful muscle movements. Push yourself to the limit - and then find balance - as each hard muscle effort is followed by a deep, relaxing stretch.
