** PHASE 3 GUIDELINES FOR SHAPE IT UP FITNESS WILL NOT ALLOW US TO OPERATE IN A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WAY:**

RE-OPEN Rhode Island guidelines:
Students need to be 6 feet apart from each other and wearing face mask while working out indoors. Students not wearing masks need to be 14 feet apart from each other while indoors. Our indoor Space is very limited with these new guidelines. 

**Unfortunately at this time Shape It Up Fitness Can NOT REOPEN-UNDER THESE GUIDELINES . Although we are working on Live Stream Classes through Zoom as well as in person classes at the same time. We are hoping to have that up and running by November.
**

We appreciate your patients and sticking with us through this difficult time! We are ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

Mary & Felix Santana
