** PHASE 3 GUIDELINES FOR SHAPE IT UP FITNESS WILL NOT ALLOW US TO OPERATE IN A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WAY:**

RE-OPEN Rhode Island guidelines:
Students need to be 6 feet apart from each other and wearing face mask while working out. Students not wearing masks need to be 14 feet apart from each other. Our Space is very limited with these new guidelines. 

**Unfortunately at this time Shape It Up Fitness Can NOT REOPEN-UNDER THESE GUIDELINES .
**

We appreciate your patients and sticking with us through this difficult time! We are ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

Mary & Felix Santana
