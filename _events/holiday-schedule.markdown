We have made the unbelievably hard choice as the concerns over COVID-19 increase to **Cancel ALL GROUP FITNESS CLASSES Temporarily starting Tuesday, March 17th.** The safety of our staff, our business and especially you, our members, is whatâ€™s most important right now. 

We take this step to ensure that our employees, and members have a secure place to return when possible. We will extend any memberships as well.

This is a time for us to be good humans and give support to our families and neighbors. When normalcy returns our team of familiar faces will welcome you in with open arms, ready to workout and celebrate the return of community!
