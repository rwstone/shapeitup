**Unfortunately, the State of Rhode Island is requring that all gyms, and fitness centers CLOSE (once again), from 11/30 - 12/13. The State of Rhode Island is calliing it a " PAUSE PHASE", with no guarantees that we would be able to reopen by Dec. 13, 2020.
but, we are offering classes via zoom.com 
starting November 30, 2020. More information to come.

We appreciate your patients and sticking with us through this difficult time! We are ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

Felix Santana
